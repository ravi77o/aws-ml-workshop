# Dataset

We are using a 182MB dataset from Kaggle.com with over 6 million records and 11 columns including:
- time
- transaction type
- amount
- origin
- old balance
- new balance
- destination
- destination old balance
- destination new balance
- whether or not the transaction is fraudulent
- whether other predefined rules marked the transaction as fraudulent

# Modeling Strategy
We are attempting two modeling strategies: one supervised, one unsupervised using SageMakers's Random Cut Forest.

It may be possible to identify networks of repeat offenders.

## Supervised - XGBoost/Linear Learner

We will train a model based on XGBoost and one on Linear Learner and evaluate effectiveness of each relative to the other.

Based on the output of that initial training, we will attempt to identify a set of actors more likely to be involved in fraudulent transactions.  As a stretch goal, we will build a(n) additional model(s) including a flag on those actors and evaluate whether that flagging increases the model's effectiveness in identifying anomalous transactions.

## Unsupervised - Random Cut Forest

We will use Random Cut Forest for the unsupervised learning model. The column that marks if fraud or not will be removed from the training data set. We will use hyperparameter tuning to get the best results by comparing it to our test data set that has if it is fraud or not.

# End Goal

Final system should be able to take in details of a single transaction and produce a score indicating the likelihood of fraud.
